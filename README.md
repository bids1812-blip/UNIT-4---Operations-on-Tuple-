UNIT 4 – Operations on Tuple 

Aim: - 
To study the concept of Tuples in Python and perform various operations such as accessing elements, repetition, and other basic Tuple operations using Python programs. 

Tools Required: -
-	Google Colab 
-	GitHub 

Theory: -
A tuple in Python is a built-in data structure used to store multiple elements in a single variable. Tuples are ordered and immutable, meaning their elements cannot be changed once created. 

Operations on Tuple: -
1.	Tuples are created using round brackets (). 
2.	Tuples cannot be added, removed, or modified directly. 
3.	Two or more tuples can be combined using the + operator. 
4.	The number of values in a tuple can be found out using len() function. 
Tuples are useful when data should remain constant throughout the program execution. 


Conclusion: -
Thus, the study of tuples and their operations in Python was successfully completed. Tuples provide a secure way to store fixed data due to their immutability. Understanding tuples is important for efficient data handling and forms a fundamental part of Python programming.
